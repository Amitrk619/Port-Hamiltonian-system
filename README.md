# Port-Hamiltonian-system

The Port Hamiltonian system (PHs) provides a framework for network modeling of multi-physics systems. I this repo the modeling of simple Mass-spring system as the interconnection of two subsystems and the linear electrical RLC circuit is provided. for both the example the simulation is done in the matlab and step response of the network is obtained.

# Simple Problem : Mass-spring

A simple problem of mass-spring is being taken for our first part of simulation. The spring-mass system consists of a point mass with weight (m), a linear spring
with spring constant (k). The point mass(m) is moving in one direction without any friction under the influence of a spring force corresponding to the spring with
constant(K).

# Linear electrical circuit with Resistor, Capacitor and Inductor

A circuit having Resistor, Inductors with magnetic energies H(Ï•) and capacitor with electric energy H(Q)connected in series form. There are
two energy storing element which are L and C, such a circuit give rise to second order differential equation and hence called second order circuit.linear electrical
circuit using Resistor, Capacitor and Inductor is equivalent to the second-order model. Although extremely simple, this example reflects some of the main characteristics of port-based network modeling: the system is regarded as the coupling 15 of the energy-storing Inductor and capacitor system with the energy-dissipating element Resistor. In general, in port-based modeling the, possibly large-scale, physical system is regarded as the interconnection of three types of ideal components: energy-storing elements, energy-dissipating (resistive) elements, and energyrouting elements.
